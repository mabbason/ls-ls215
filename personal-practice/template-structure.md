# Problem structure
  
  // Input

  // Output

  // Rules


# Examples
    # Walk through the 'steps'
    # First understand the 'Happy Path'

# Data Structure
    # What lends itself to working with the problem

# Algorithm: Break down by functions (main, helper, input validation)

    # What are just the headlines? What's the BIG IDEA of what I am trying to do?

    # Where does the problem lend itself to being broken down into smaller functions

    # Walk through the 'steps' with the 'happy path' to see where there might be a lack of understanding
      - If there is...
        - Can the issue be broken down further?
        - Is there a pattern that I am missing? Look at examples.

  // Code

//TEST CASES:
  // HAPPY PATHS:
    console.log(**name**() === ); // 
    console.log(**name**() === ); //

  // EDGE CASES:
    console.log(**name**() === ); // 
    console.log(**name**() === ); //

  // FAILURES/BAD INPUTS:
    console.log(**name**() === ); // 
    console.log(**name**() === ); //
